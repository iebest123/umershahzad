                <p>Beef, however, is the culinary name for meat from cattle, in the sense that beef comes from cattle apart from cows as well as the bull. Beef is reared from male and female cattle. However, the females remain heifers and are continuously breeding to produce calves for dairy and to get slaughtered for meat.</p>

            <p>Sushi is made of small pieces of raw fish that are wrapped in rice and seaweed. The seaweed, called nori, is collected with submerged bamboo nets. While some sushi is mass-produced using robots, the best sushi is made by hand. ... Wasabi and soy sauce are commonly used to flavor sushi rolls.</p>
